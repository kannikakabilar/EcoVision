- How does EcoVision calculate the ESG score?
EcoVision calculates the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) score by employing a formula that quantifies the environmental impact of code optimizations. The ESG score is determined by considering various factors such as the carbon intensity of electricity and the energy consumed during the execution of each stage in the DevOps pipeline. 

	- ESG Score Calculation: EcoVision assigns an ESG score to each recommended stage in the pipeline. This score is calculated by multiplying the carbon intensity of electricity by the energy consumed during the execution of each stage

	- Total Weight ESG Metric: The ESG metric formula used by EcoVision is as follows: Total Weight ESG = Total Weight / (Weight CPU x ΔCPU + Weight Energy x ΔEnergy + Weight Carbon x ΔCarbon). This formula helps quantify the environmental impact of code optimizations

	- ESG Metrics Collection: EcoVision also integrates with a common plug-and-play framework called EcoSync, which collects ESG metrics from a multi-varied technological and business environment. This data is then used to provide ESG reports, predictive insights, and implementable advice to enhance ESG investment or score

	- Granular ESG Tagging: EcoSync, as part of EcoVision, allows for granular ESG monitoring, enabling tagging at the CPU and core level, which contributes to carbon emission reduction

The ESG score is a crucial indicator of the environmental impact of software development activities and is used to guide developers in making more sustainable coding decisions.
